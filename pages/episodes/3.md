Richie Artoul is a software engineer on Uber's Observability infrastructure team. He also really likes distributed timeseries databases, like a lot.

> Find out how Richie Artoul went from bootcamp grad to infrastructure engineer at Uber, where he's now building their open source metrics platform M3 and their open source distributed timeseries database M3DB. Charlie and Oz dive into Richie's tips for side projects, reading programming textbooks, finding mentors at work, and navigating large engineering orgs like Uber. We also learn that Richie recently took up Jiu-Jitsu (just like Oz) - and now Charlie's hoping for a Vader / Obi Wan style "roll" in their future.
