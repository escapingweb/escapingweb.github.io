Lauren Budorick is Graphics Software Engineer at Figma. Sheâ€™s also read the 1989a .gif spec, yet still refuses to pronounce them as "JIFs."

> Find out how Lauren went from bootcamp grad to Graphics Software Engineer, first at Mapbox and now at Figma, where she's building their prototyping rendering engine. Charlie and Oz dig into Lauren's tips for learning linear algebra, how to see everything in the world as a triangle, and navigating a company without managers. Charlie and Oz also each try to recount stories of "achieving the impossible", and both painfully fail to remember the exact details of their anecdotes.
