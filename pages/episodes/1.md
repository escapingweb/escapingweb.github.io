Felix Tripier is a software engineer at a quantum computing company. He's also eating cold lasagna out of a coffee mug.

> Find out how Felix Tripier went from high-school and college dropout (watch out Silicon Valley, he's a double-dropout) to working as web developer at several Bay Area startups to presenting his open-source research at a quantum computing conference, leading to his current gig as a software engineer at IonQ, a quantum computing company. Charlie and Oz dig into Felix's study habits and learning goals, briefly dip into theoretical computing topics before coming up for air, and altogether forget to introduce themselves, Felix, or the podcast itself.
