    <title>1: A Quantum of Sad Things Happening To Felix Tripier of IonQ</title>

  <body>
    <p>Felix Tripier is a software engineer at a quantum computing company. He&#39;s also eating cold lasagna out of a coffee mug.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Find out how Felix Tripier went from high-school and college dropout (watch out Silicon Valley, he&#39;s a double-dropout) to working as web developer at several Bay Area startups to presenting his open-source research at a quantum computing conference, leading to his current gig as a software engineer at IonQ, a quantum computing company. Charlie and Oz dig into Felix&#39;s study habits and learning goals, briefly dip into theoretical computing topics before coming up for air, and altogether forget to introduce themselves, Felix, or the podcast itself.</p>
