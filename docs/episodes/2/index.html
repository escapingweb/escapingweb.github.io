    <p>Roo Harrigan is the Strategic Engineering Projects Lead at Slack. Sheâ€™s also the self-proclaimed Mentor Queen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Find out how Roo Harrigan went from an all-around generalist (product manager, project manager, sales demo&#39;er, customer support agent) to a software engineer on the platform team at Slack, and now the Strategic Engineering Projects Lead reporting to Slack&#39;s CTO. Charlie and Oz dig into about Roo&#39;s tips for finding mentors, achieving flow state, and onboarding engineers. We also learn that Oz has never worked in the food services industry. Oh, and they remember to introduce themselves and Roo at the beginning. Progress!</p>
